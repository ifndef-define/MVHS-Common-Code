# Metea Valley Robotics Code Repository
**Welcome to Metea Valley Robotics!!!**
Written By: Anissh Guruprasad \[Captain of MVHS Robotics - Metea Class of 2023\]

### The Purpose of this Repository
Over the years, we the alumni of the MVHS Robotics Club have seen many teams struggle with programming their robot, whether its because no one knows how to code, or there wasn't enough time to create a program on their own. So we decided to create a common ground repository available to all robotics members and teams to utilize the head start and feature code provided here. This repository will serve three purposes;

1) Allow robotics teams to get a head start programming their robot so that they can focus more on testing and developing their robot, rather than working on a program from scratch
2) Teach students how to code using VexCode Pro V5 (Or Go the advanced route and program in [PROS-Code](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/))
3) Provide Other Useful Programs regarding cool features and testing out the senors and electronics for functionality

##### Disclaimer
First we would like to mention, this code is provided as a resource for you to learn how to code, get a head start in robotics, and get rid of the tedious process of building efficient code so your team can focus on the testing and development of your program, rather than substituting your work for the sake of not doing any work.
