# Metea Valley Robotics Code Repository

**Welcome to Metea Valley Robotics!!!**

**Written By:** Anissh Guruprasad \[Captain of MVHS Robotics - Metea Class of 2023\]

## !!! Disclaimer !!!
First we would like to mention, this code is provided as a resource for you to learn how to code, get a head start in programming, and get rid of the tedious process of building efficient code so your team can focus on the testing and development of your program. This program is not provided as a means to substitute your effort for the sake of not doing any work. To combat this issue, you will have to write most of the code for your robot since every robot is different and we intend for this program to be able to serve as a template for multiple seasons of Vex Robotics.
As per Vex Rules, **\< G6 \>** specifically applies in this case, so by having the team programmer(s) write the functional portion of the code, it is still legal to operate this repository.

### The Purpose of this Repository
Over the years, we the alumni of the MVHS Robotics Club have seen many teams struggle with programming their robot, whether its because no one knows how to code, there wasn't enough time to create a program on their own, or there were missed opportunities to take advantages of clever programming and cool features. So we decided to create a common ground repository available to all robotics members and teams to utilize. There are many programs like a headstart template, learning code, device checking programs, etc. All these resources are provided to help you become a better coder. 

This repository will serve three purposes;
1) Allow robotics teams to get a head start programming their robot so that they can focus more on testing and developing their robot making it better than it already is, rather than working on a program from scratch, allocating time for something that is already known.
2) Teach students how to code using VexCode Pro V5 (Or Go the advanced route and program in [PROS-Code](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/)) in the C++ coding language. (Sorry Python users, as of right now, you're on your own. If you would like to help convert these programs to Python feel free to reach out to me at [anisshachar@hotmail.com](mailto:anisshachar@hotmail.com))
3) Provide Other Useful Programs regarding cool features and testing out the senors and electronics for functionality

#### Repository Rules
1) All code in this repository is **Copyright (C) of 17990 Ethereal and Metea Valley Robotics** under the MIT license. DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHER ROBOTICS TEAMS OUTSIDE METEA. This can result in termination of this repository.
2) You will still have to write most of the code for your robot.

    Every robot is different. Know that you will have to write most of the code for your team's robot. If you have coding questions, please see your Captains or consult to the Ethereal Robotics YouTube Channel for the [VexCode Coding Series](https://www.youtube.com/@etherealrobotics7005) or [PROS Code Series](https://www.youtube.com/@etherealrobotics7005). (Yes I made these)
3) You may make any changes/modifications to the code provided in this repository once you download it, however, I would recommend leaving the source code untouched, unless you know exactly what you are doing.
4) **Any bugs you find please submit an issue with details regarding the bug so that I can address the master copy.**

## Programs Provided in this Repository

### MV Head Start Template
> This program is the heart of this repository. It is a template code that contains many preprogrammed features, code, auton development strategies and methods of organizations. This removes the bulk amount of the teidous programming, allowing programmers to implement their code and develop much more effecient and realiable programs in the time they have alloated. This repository will also allow teams who don't have backround in coding to utlize more advanced features, without needing to develop its respective code.

### Device Checker
> A simple program that allows you to test each device with a constant source of data to ensure sensors are accurate and are working to the tolerance they are developed to.

### Features and Cool Things
> After the important programming is done, it is time to implement the non-vital features like auton selectors, simple gui interface for both the Controller and/or Brain, etc. If you would like to submit a feature/program request do so in the issues tab.

### VexCode Learning
> Want to learn all about programming in VexCode? This folder will contain programs that will teach you the basics of programming in VexCode Pro V5. This also contains portions of code from the [VexCode Coding Series](https://www.youtube.com/@etherealrobotics7005) on the Ethereal Robotics YouTube Channel. Any questions on programming see your robotics Captian.
