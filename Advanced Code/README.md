# Advanced Code
**Program By**: Anissh Guruprasad

**Last Updated**: n/a

**Purpose**: Since we don't want to take away all the fun with building code, we have provided reasources to a lot of advanced code alorigthms that if implemented can give your team the upper hand in competitions. As you can see, there is no code in this folder. This is because we want you to take your own measures to develop these alorigthms since they are very powerful. We have provided wikis, YouTube videos, articles, and PDFs, that explain how these alorithms works, so that you can learn them and program them yourself.
