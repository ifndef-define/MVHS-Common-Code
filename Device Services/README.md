# Device Services
**Program By**: Anissh Guruprasad
**Last Updated**: n/a
**Purpose**: The program is designed to test all the V5 electronics and sensors for functionality. An example can be ensuring proper reading of the distance sensor, color readings from an optical sensor, or even check whether three-wire devices return any output. This program is written using VexCode Pro V5 to allow for all teams to test the sensors. This program is **AS IS** and does not need any sort of programming or changes to be made. You simply download the program (via VexCode Pro), and run it, and follow the directions shown on the brain screen and/or computer terminal. See directions below;
**Mentions**: This project uses [jpearman's vexcode-lvgllib5_3](https://github.com/jpearman/vexcode-lvgllib5_3) to allow use of [LVGL](www.lvgl.io) on VexCode. (**_NOTE_**: This lvgl library is an outdated version (v5.3.0) that was installed on PROS Kernel 3.8.0. The reason for use is the lack of needing an updated version, and cross compatibility when developing this program.)
