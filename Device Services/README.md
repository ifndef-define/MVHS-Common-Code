# Device Services
**Program By**: Anissh Guruprasad

**Last Updated**: n/a

**Purpose**: The program is designed to test all the V5 electronics and sensors for functionality. An example can be ensuring proper reading of the distance sensor, color readings from an optical sensor, or even check whether three-wire devices return any output. This program is written using VexCode Pro V5 to allow for all teams to test the sensors. This program is **AS IS** and does not need any sort of programming or changes to be made (expect for port config). You simply download the program (via VexCode Pro), and run it, and follow the directions shown on the brain screen and/or computer terminal. See directions below;

**Mentions**: This project uses [jpearman's vexcode-lvgllib5_3](https://github.com/jpearman/vexcode-lvgllib5_3) to allow use of [LVGL](https://www.lvgl.io) on VexCode. (**_NOTE_**: This lvgl library is an outdated version (v5.3.0) that was installed on PROS Kernel 3.8.0. The reason for use is the lack of needing an updated version, and cross compatibility when developing this program.)

## Directions of Use
1) Go to the main page of the repository and download the repository zip
2) Extract the downloaded zip
3) Open VexCode Pro V5 and open the `.v5code` file inside the Device Services folder, This should open the program inside VexCode
4) Connect the brain to the computer via a build cable and leave it connected
5) Choose a slot to download the program on the top of the window, then press the build button on the top right or press Ctrl+B on your keyboard
6) On the computer, select the `terminal` tab on the bottom of the screen next to `output`. Instructions and certain information from tests.
7) From here follow directions on the screen and on the brain to test the devices you choose
8) If a port on the brain is not working, (instructions to change based on program)
